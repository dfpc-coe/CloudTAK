When editing files, please follow these guidelines:
- **Clarity**: Ensure that your changes are clear and easy to understand. Use descriptive commit messages and comments where necessary.
- **Consistency**: Maintain consistent coding styles and conventions throughout the project. Adhere to existing patterns unless there's a compelling reason to deviate.
- **Web**: When possible use BootStrap 5 for styling and layout to ensure responsiveness and compatibility across different devices.
